## Motivation
My motivation for this was to practice using APIs, and learned more about it.


## Purpose
The purpose of the Weather App, is to give real time data of the weather based on the inputted City.

## HOW DO YOU USE:
It's very simple, Open the AppLauncher and input the city that you want to look up
### This is an example if I wanted to see the weather for Boston:

### This is an example for Sacremento:

## HOW IT WORKS
After you input your City, State, or Country, based on the weather the GUI, will change colors, or the image displayed, with the updated weather temperature, time, humidity, and precipitation.

 - Cloudy 🌥️ - Gray Background, with a word displayed *Cloudy*
 - Sunny ☀️ - Bright Blue Background with a word displayed *Clear*
 - Rainy 🌨️ - Dark Blue Background with a word displayed *Rainy*
 - Snowy ❄️ - A white Background with a word displayed *Snowy*

## API USED
I used the OpenWeatherMap API to track realtime weather information based on the location inputted, using the GET methods.
I also used the geolocation API, to retrieve the data for the cities, so it can be used in the weatherApp
